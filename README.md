## **Projects and Applications**
For each of these courses, I have worked on various projects that demonstrate the application of these concepts. The repository includes:
- Code implementations of algorithms and data structures
- System-level programming exercises in C
- Software engineering projects with Agile workflows
- Operating system simulations and concurrency exercises
- Database projects with SQL and NoSQL
