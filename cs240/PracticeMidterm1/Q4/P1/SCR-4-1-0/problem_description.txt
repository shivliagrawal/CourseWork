                             REDIRECTING INPUT
                             _________________

These problems do not use FILE i/o within the program, instead they use input
redirection to send a file's contents to "stdin" which the program will read
from.  This can be done by running the program like so:
		./mytest < sample_input.txt

Input can also be entered manually by running the compiled program, then
entering each desired input value.  When you are done entering values, you will
need to let the program know you are finished by pressing "ctrl + d".  This
sets the EOF flag.

                             _________________

getchar(), ungetc(...), atoi(...), scanf(...), printf(..), getline(...)
	Remember that you have access to the 'man' pages.


                             PROBLEM DESCRIPTION
                             ___________________

You will create your own SCR-4-1-0.c file that contains the function `void printNums()`.
This function reads in a stream of integers from stdin into an array.  The
input will be a list of integers that are separated by a space. After the final
integer in the file, there will immediately be a newline character to signal
that all of the integers have been read.  The array is then printed in the
order it was read in the given format.  


                             EXAMPLES
                             ________

Input File contains:  "3 1 4 2 5\n"
Function Outputs:     "{3, 1, 4, 2, 5}\n"

Input File contains:  "1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n"
Function Outputs:     "{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}\n"

Input File contains:  nothing or empty file
Function Outputs:     "No integers were provided.\n"
